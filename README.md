## Introduction
This game is a roguelike RPG, where the player dwells in randomly generated dungeons slaying monsters, gathering loot and trying to survive. It's in very early stage, where some basic stuff, such as dungeon generation, are implemented.

# Current status
**Several things are implemented (note: not fully):**
* Random dungeon generation: Generates dungeon layouts automatically (width, height, openness)
* Tilesystem: Creates seamless graphics using tilesystem.
* Basic AI: Enemies follow player and uses melee attacks.
* Image to dungeon generator: Generates dungeons and special rooms using hand drawn images (pixel array).
* Loot rarity mechanics/probability calculations: Items come in four different levels (normal, magical, rare, legendary).
* Crude/basic experience system: Player gain exp by killing enemies.
* Pixelart graphics: Tiles are 16x16 and are created by hand using Pyxel edit software.
* Player has slots for armor, weapon, spell and usable items (such as potions).
* Armor degenerates when damage taken: You have to look for armor constantly.

**These things are under development:**
* More weapons, spells, usable items.
* Item throwing?
* Effects and animations.
* Different enemy types and more diverse enemy behaviour.
* Special handcrafted rooms such as shops, random encounters, boss rooms etc.
* Light background story why all this happens.
* Better menus and death screens.
* Sound effects.
* Character selection: Player can select from premade characters, who all have different starting gear and conditions.
